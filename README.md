# Adopt Insect

This is simple website created in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, designed and created completely by myself. Actually, with little support of my boyfriend :)

The main goal of this project is to develop my skills in front-end:
- using GIT,
- keeping order in files structure,
- using BEM,
- fetching and displaying data from json file,
- creating simple functions to manage DOM,
- using local font,
- svg animations, 
- responsive web design (RWD),
- hamburger menu for mobile view.
